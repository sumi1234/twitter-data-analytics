twitter-data-analytics
======================

This repo consists of python scripts to analyze twitter data - both real-time and stored.

The repository consists of the following : 
1. A web application to determine the sentiment of an entity based on twitter data in real-time.
2. Script to mine and preprocess twitter data.
3. Script to analyze twitter data using sample data collected during the football world cup final.
4. Script demonstrating sentiment analysis of twitter data.


Dependencies:
The project was developed using python 2.7.6.
External libraries used include pandas, numpy, sklearn, nltk, flask.

I will soon be adding the code in the form of ipython notebooks.
